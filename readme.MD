## 2d game of snake with a basic AI decision algorithm that we want to implement a ML learning model into with 0 prior ML knowledge. 

# Install and run on windows:
1. Create a venv `py -m venv venv`
2. Install dependencies `pip install .`
3. Run `py snaik.py`

# Notes

Need to decide on
1. the type of learning algorithm
2. the type of neural network

Using a genetic learning algorithm (cool to watch) to train a neural network is an example i saw of someone trying the same. It didn't do very well though, like similar to my basic AI after many generations. But it definitely learnred over time.

Another example was reinforcement learning algorithm with a deep Q neural network. Similar results.
